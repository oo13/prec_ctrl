    For convenience, this library provides some functions for std::accumulate() and you can specify the precision of the accumulation.

    FixedPoint::operator+() automatically determines the precision of the result, but:
    - It cannot use for std::accumulation() because FixedPoint::operator+() returns the value whose type is the different from the type of the input.
    - Some programmers can use the knowledge of the application and determine to reduce the required precision.

    The functions don't use FixedPoint as the accumulator, so you should recover the value of FixedPoint after you get the last result of the accumulation.

    For example:
    \code
      std::vector<FixedPoint<16, -8>> a;
      ...
      auto tmp = std::accumulate(a.begin(), a.end(), significand_t<20>(0), int_adder<20, 16, -8>);
      FixedPoint<20, -8> sum;
      sum.set_significand(tmp); // This may cause to clamp tmp.
    \endcode
